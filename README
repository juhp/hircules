Hircules (pronounced like the Greek Hero) is an IRC
(Internet Relay Chat) client written in the functional
programming language Haskell (<http://haskell.org/).  See
the "index.html" file for more details.  The present code
evolved from Lambdabot by Andrew J. Bromage et al.

The latest version is available from <http://haskell.org/hircules/>.
