Subject: [Gtk2hs-users] Announce: hircules IRC client 0.3 released
Date: Sun, 05 Oct 2003 22:08:16 +0900

It's a pleasure to announce the release of Hircules 0.3.

Hircules is an IRC client written in Haskell, using gtk2hs
for its gui.  Since the last release about 3 months ago,
various bugs have been fixed and a good number of new
features added, including better charset support and tab
highlighting.  A summary of the main changes is appended
below.

See the Hircules webpage <http://haskell.org/hircules/> for
more details.  A source tarball and an i386 rpm built for Linux
with glibc-2.3 and gtk2-2.2 are available for download from
the project site page <http://sourceforge.net/project/showfiles.php?group_id=81211>.

Enjoy,

Jens

I am happy to announce the release of Hircules 0.2.

Hircules is an IRC client written in Haskell, using gtk2hs
for its user interface.  Since the last release about 2 months
ago, many bugs have been fixed and some new features added.
A brief list of the main changes is appended below.

See the Hircules webpage <http://haskell.org/hircules/> for
more details.  A source tarball and an i386 rpm built for Linux
with glibc-2.3 and gtk2-2.2 are available for download from
the project site page <http://sourceforge.net/projects/hircules/>.

Going forward I want to make an effort to keep the cvs repository
more up-to-date with more regular commits.  The TODO list contains
the list of features I would like to implement in coming versions.

Enjoy, and as usual please send your feedback and comments,

Jens

Hello,

I am pleased to announce the first release of Hircules,
an IRC client written in Haskell. It uses gtk2hs for the UI.
The present code evolved from Lambdabot 1.0 by Andrew Bromage et al.
(I hope it will be possible to factor out a nice IRC library from
Lambdabot and Hircules, to avoid duplication of code and effort --
certainly I can see plenty of improvements that could be made in
the structuring and code of Hircules.)

Hircules is still quite basic in terms of features, and though
I think it can be used for basic chatting, I would describe it as
alpha quality software. It supports channel tabs, a raw irc tab
and an all channel tab. It is also possible to use lambdabot
extension modules, though by default most of them are disabled
currently.

The source code and rpms can now be downloaded from:

        http://haskell.org/hircules/

Give it a try if you can!  Comments on the design, bug reports, rfe's,
contributions, etc are most welcome.  I hope to have a cvs repository
up soon to make it more accessible.

Cheers, Jens
